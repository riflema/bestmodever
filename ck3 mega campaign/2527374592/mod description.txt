Version 1.2.0; this mod is a work in progress.

This mod adds five start dates, eleven cultures, and six decisions to form titles, along with various minor changes. Supports English and French (courtesy of Aliocha), though there is also some limited support for German, Spanish, and Russian, but not a lot. Feedback is very much appreciated.

[h1]Formable titles[/h1]
[list]

[*][b]Kingdom of Sicily:[/b] In the 1337 start date, if the King of Naples or the King of Trinacria holds both thrones and all de jure land therein, the two Kingdoms of Sicily can be reunified back into a single Kingdom of Sicily!
[*][b]Principality of Carantania:[/b] As a ruler of Windic culture who holds the duchies of Carinthia, Steyermark, and Krain, the Principality of Carantania can be restored!
[*][b]Bulgarian Empire:[/b] The Bulgarian Empire is only recognized as a mere kingdom by those outside of it. By having enough land, others will finally recognize our Tsar as a true emperor!
