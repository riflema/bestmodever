 bm_1204_latin_empire_desc:0 "The notorious and ill-fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders, and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV, seeking to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states in Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty."
