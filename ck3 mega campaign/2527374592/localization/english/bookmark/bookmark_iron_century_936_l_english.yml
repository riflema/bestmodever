 bm_936_iron_century_desc:1 "On the 7th of August, 936, Otto I was crowned King of the Germans. He initiated his arduous campaign to crush his rivals and reconquer the lost territory in Italy to reform the Holy Roman Empire. The Magyars settled down in the Carpathian Basin and began to make their mark on the world as they conquered and pillaged their neighbors, becoming feared across Europe. In the north the Christians were trying to push into the Scandinavian Peninsula to start converting the pagan kings, but the Germanic faith still stood strong among the vikings. In Baghdad far to the south-east, the ancient Abbasid Caliphate that once ruled an empire stretching from Persia to Hispania finally fell to infighting, left only with the heartland of their former empire. And on the shores of Africa a new rival rose up in the form of the Fatimid Caliphate, ready to fill the vacant regions left behind by their adversary."

 bookmark_iron_century_otto_desc:0 "The eldest son of Henry the Fowler, Otto inherited the large but disunited Kingdom of Germany. Favoring central authority and a firm hand in contrast with his father's more permissive rule, he will go on to be the first Emperor of the Romans since Louis the Pious to hold the majority of its lands. In doing so, he will contend with opposition on all sides, and eventually pacify the irreverent vassals inside his realm, the Italians to the South, and the Magyars to the East. His descendants will continue to serve as Holy Roman Emperors for another century.\n\n#bold Can you achieve what he did and create an Empire that will endure the ages? Or will you be overwhelmed by what it takes to be truly Great?#!"

 bookmark_iron_century_aethelstan_desc:0 "The grandson of Alfred the Great, Æthelstan's rise to power came through the dubious fortune of both his father and brother dying within weeks of one another. Fighting off those with the audacity to dispute his birthright and eventually a coalition, he emerged to become victorious and was crowned the first King of the English. His relatively short rule would see an intellectually rich court life, expansion of the rule of law and a sincere concern for the well-being of his subjects.\n\n#bold With fortune and providence, Æthelstan's story doesn't need to end as it did. Is more greatness in store, or will your ascendance be similarly cut short?#!"

 bookmark_iron_century_hakon_desc:0 "A son of Harald Fairhair, Hakon is the first King of Norway to accept the Catholic faith, though many doubt his sincerity and consider him an apostate who did not truly let go of his ancestral faith. Succeeding an unpopular despot, Hakon's rule is fraught with threats from the disparate tribes he ruled over, rival claimants, and the King of Denmark, the last of which will eventually defeat him in battle, where he will be slain.\n\n#bold Are you cursed to suffer the same ignominious fate? Or can you negotiate, plot and fight your way out?#!"

Much glory awaits the Fatimids in the following century, though how much of it Al-Qaim can partake in himself is uncertain.\n\n#bold Will chance allow you to expedite your family's destiny?

As the leader of the Qarmatians, he and his line will continue their ascent for most of the century, until finally being contained by the Abbasids. Surrounded by outraged enemies, it will take far more than mere banditry to survive and flourish.\n\n#bold It will take both guile and military acumen to stop your faith from going down in history as yet another bushfire heresy.#!"

Having led numerous successful raids into a Germany engulfed in civil strife, Zolta is one of the greatest threats to the Holy Roman ascendance. It won't be until after his death that the Magyar menace is defeated, never again to return as a mortal threat to Europe.\n\n#bold Can you smother the German ember before it is too late?
