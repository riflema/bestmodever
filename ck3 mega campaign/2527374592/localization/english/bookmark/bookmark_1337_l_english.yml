 bm_1337_late_desc:0 "Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring..."

 #Edward III

 bookmark_1337_edward_desc:0 "Less than a decade has passed since Edward avenged his father's death at the hands of his perfidious mother and her lover. Blaming the ailings of England on the profligate rule of the usurpers, he was able to quickly secure the loyalty of his subjects and start looking outward. The heirless death of his uncle Charles the Fair, as well as his own military successes in Scotland have encouraged him to press his claim as the rightful King of France, a claim that is certain to be met by both legal and violent objection.\n\n#nbold You must be prepared for a protracted and costly war to secure your birthright. Can you unite the two crowns, or will you have to seek your destiny elsewhere beyond the seas?#!"
 
 #Philippe VI

 bookmark_1337_philip_desc:0 "The extinction of the Capets was indeed fortunate for Philip, who found himself elevated from minor nobility to royalty due to a legal technicality in French succession law in lieu of Edward, who was the closer male relative to the last Capetian King. Attempting to strip Edward of his titles and holdings in France was the last insult in a long history of gradually increasing hostility between the two kings, prompting the young warrior king to press his claim to the throne of France by force. \n\n#bold Provoking one of the finest military minds has put you in a situation where you must once again rely on Lady Fortune's favor. Will you be able to secure France for your family, or will the House of Valois be smothered in the cradle?#!"

 bookmark_1337_casimir_desc:0 "Having recently inherited the tenuously re-united Kingdom of Poland from his father Władysław, Casimir is resolved to complete his father's work in creating a strong Polish state. Much work lies ahead of him as territories need to be integrated, laws need to be codified and nobility who oppose his reforms and attempts to extend protections to peasants and Jews need to be pacified. His complicated and problematic personal life, as well misfortune in trying to produce a legal heir will lead to the extinction of storied and esteemed Piasts. \n\n#bold To secure Poland, not just for his own sake but for the Piasts, Casimir will have to win in love as well as in war. Will your family live on in prosperity, or will you leave the fruits of your labor for others to savor?#!"

 #Orhan Ottoman

His rule thus far saw successful wars with the Byzantine Empire and the consequent rapid expansion of the Ottoman Turks to become one of the most powerful and prosperous beyliks, with more conquests yet to come. Fate allowing, he will have more than tripled the size of his domain by the end of his rule, with his descendants going on to create one of the largest contiguous and longest lasting empires the world has ever seen.\n\n#bold Uniting the shardlings of the shattered Rum will be long and arduous. Much has already been accomplished, while much more has yet to be.#!"

 bookmark_1337_ozbeg_desc:0 "Mohammed Özbeg was the longest reigning khan of the Golden Horde, and it was under him that the Mongol splinter state reached the height of its power. Özbeg was converted to Islam at an early age, and upon assuming the throne he adopted it as a state religion. Despite this he was known to be highly tolerant of Christians, something that Pope John XXII would personally thank him for in a letter."

 bookmark_1337_muhammad_desc:0 "Muhammad II was the head of the Tughluq dynasty, which had carved out a vast Muslim empire in India. Under him, the empire initially expanded to temporarily control most of India, but it was not to last. Muhammad had a well-earned reputation for ruthlessness and cruelty, and taxes in his empire were raised to exorbitant levels. He had to contend with numerous revolts, and by the time of his death the realm had already begun to fragment."

His successful diplomacy, willful obedience, and economic cunning have all helped Moscow prosper immensely, marking the start of an ascendancy that will be uninterrupted for centuries.\n\n#bold Ivan begged, borrowed, and bargained to create the foundation for the state that will reach heights unimaginable to him under the rule of his descendants. Are you content with letting younger generations fulfill your destiny, or do you intend to be more proactive about securing this glorious future?#!"
