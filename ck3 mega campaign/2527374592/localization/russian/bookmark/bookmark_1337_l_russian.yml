 bm_1337_late_desc:0 "Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring..."

 bookmark_1337_edward_desc:0 "Edward III was in many ways a warrior king, who was crowned after the disastrous reign of his father came to an end in 1327. Under Edward, England was transformed into one of most formidable military powers in Europe and his claim to the French throne would begin the conflict that eventually became known as the Hundred Years War. During his long reign, which would go on to last fifty years, Edward focused mostly on military matters. He personally oversaw the decisive Battle of Crécy, where an English army consisting mostly of longbowmen defeated a much larger French force."

Despite Philippe's nickname, the war did not go well, and the French army was virtually annihilated at the hands of the English during the Battle of Crécy. At the end of his reign the Black Death made its first appearance in France. A full third of the subjects in his kingdom succumbed to this plague - including Philippe's wife, Queen Joan."

During his lifetime he went on military campaigns to expand his realm to the east and solidify his borders in the west. To get support from the Hungarian nobles he also promised them the Polish throne if he would end up heirless. Unfortunately he didn't manage to produce a legal male heir, in spite of his four different marriages, and after his death in 1370 the Hungarians pressed their claim to the Polish crown and ended the Piast dynasty."
