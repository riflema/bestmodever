 bm_1081_alexiad_desc:0 "After a series of devastating losses to invading Turkish forces, the Byzantine Empire is reeling. But there is hope - the great general Alexios Komnenos has just seized the throne from the corrupt Nikephoros III. Alexios - whose life was documented by his daughter Anna in 'the Alexiad' - and his successors would halt the decline of the Empire and push back the Turkish invaders from western Anatolia, buying more time to the ailing remnants of the old Roman Empire. For now, Anatolia is ruled by Suleyman I, a member of the Seljuk dynasty, who arrogantly calls his new state the 'Sultanate of Rum' (Rome)."

Most of Anatolia is currently occupied by the Seljuk Turks, and the Normans of Sicily are eyeing the Balkans.\n\n#bold Can you push back the invaders and restore Byzantine dominance in the Mediterranean?#!"

His father had struggled against Alp Arslan for the throne of Great Seljuq Empire. Suleyman fled with his three brothers after his father died, but only he alone survived the raids launched by Alp Arslan."
