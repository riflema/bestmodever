Shorten provided bookmark character descriptions

Add more tribal holders in 936 and 1204

Add the Short and the Small nicknames?

Move Nasrids (Sistan) in 1066 and 1081 from Jabal Qufs to the actual Sistan? Probably put the Seljuk character there in Jabal Qufs in exchange

Switch Görlitz and Lubsko so that Lubsko is the county that is Polish in some dates instead of Görlitz (though this could result in disconnected territory)

#Considerations
Changed Scottish kings before David I (1124) to Gaelic for historical accuracy?

Add Kumyk Shamkhals?


Possible future cultures (somewhat unlikely):
	Azeri (Iranian group? Turkic group?) to replace the one or two Oghuz counties in Azerbaijan; probably don't use it in Shirvan. In culture update: Iranian heritage, Oghuz language
	Split Ethiopian into multiple: Tigrayan, Amhara, Tigre, Agew (last of which is Cushitic like Somali)
	Luri (in Luristan)
		
Think of court languages:
	Persian: Delhi (1337) and Rum (1081, 1187, 1204)
	Chinese?: Kara-Khitai (pretender Liao dynasty), Mongolia (1337, Yuan dynasty)
	French: England in 1081 and later, Scotland in 1124 and later (David I)
