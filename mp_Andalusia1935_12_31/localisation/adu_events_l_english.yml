They propose that we align ourselves with them and that we each apologize to eachother for what happened in the Brothers' War, which we all know of too well. Perhaps they are of pure intentions, or perhaps this is just another trick in their crusade against our people."

 andalusia.11.t:0 "A United African Colony?"
 andalusia.11.d:0 "Now that we have quelled rebellion in the colonies, shall we unite them into a singular colony so that it may be easier to manage? Or perhaps this is a stupid proposition which shouldn't have been suggested in the first place."
 andalusia.11.a:0 "Accept the proposition."
 andalusia.11.b:0 "What an idiotic idea!"
