His leadership has brought Andalusia to a prime place in the world stage, and much of the Andulusian populace is saddened by his passing.

 andalusia.2.d:0 "The Andalusian Premier, Bancisco Banco, has sent a delegation to our nation in hopes of a greater relationship between our countries.

 andalusia.3.t:0 "The Avilan Proposition"

 andalusia.4.t:0 "An Andalusian Alliance"

They propose that we align ourselves with them and that we each apologize to eachother for what happened in the Brothers' War, which we all know of too well. Perhaps they are of pure intentions, or perhaps this is just another trick in their crusade against our people."

 andalusia.5.a:0 "Great!"
 andalusia.6.t:0 "Our Delegation Denied"
 andalusia.6.d:0 "The Asturians have denied our delegation request to repair the relationship between our nations. Those scandalous Asturians must not yet realize the great effect a partnership could have between our nations. We must keep trying to mend this bond."

 andalusia.7.t:0 "The Avilan Exhange"

 andalusia.7.a:0 "Interesting."
 andalusia.7.b:0 "A great future is ahead of us!"
